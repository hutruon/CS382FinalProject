Tower Guardians
Tower Guardians is a strategic tower defense game where you'll experience a unique blend of relaxed and intense gameplay.  Carefully place towers to eliminate enemies and progress through the levels.

Gameplay
- Start each level with $1000 to purchase towers. Choose between cannons, castles, or a combination of both to build your defenses.
- Earn more money as you destroy enemies. This allows you to buy and place more towers throughout the level.
- The challenge ramps up! Enemy wave speed increases slightly with each wave and more significantly with each level.
- Target and conquer! Each enemy has a health bar that depletes with your tower attacks. Enemy health also decreases slightly with each level, making them progressively easier to eliminate.
- Every enemy that reaches the end weakens your defenses. Lose a point from your total enemy health for each one that slips by. Once your enemy health reaches zero, the game is over.
- Take a breather! The game can be paused at any time using the pause button. The pause menu lets you resume play, quit the game entirely, or start a new game

To start the game, make sure to hit the next wave button and then once that wave is over, the next wave button should appear again so click it again for the next wave. 
This was done to give you enough time between the waves to strategize and carefully place the towers in your desired locations.

In order to add the towers onto the map click the tower and then select the area where you would like to place the tower
